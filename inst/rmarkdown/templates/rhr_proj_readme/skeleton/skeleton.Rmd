# Reproducibility
<!-- Consider using renv for reproducibility. Delete this section if you will not be doing this. -->
This repository uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) to create a reproducible environment for this R project. 

1. When you first launches this project, `renv` should automatically bootstrap itself, thereby downloading and installing the appropriate version of `renv` into the project library. 
2. After this has completed, you can use `renv::restore()` to restore the project library locally on your machine.

For more information on collaborating with `renv`, please refer to this [link](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/collaborating.html).
